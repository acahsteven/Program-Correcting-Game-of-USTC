# Program-Correcting-Game-of-USTC
**Important:this project is based on the [Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/), Creator version:3.4.2, basic lib, temp and other dependencies are not included.**  
**This is only a repository of original codes, no executable versions available yet.**  
To run it, please create an empty 2D project in the corresponding version of cocos creator, then clone this repository **else where**, 
copy all elements into the empty project, replace all the files with same name name, 
finally use the creator to open the project and press the "Play on Device" button at medium-top.  
No dependencies needed now, but plan to use the "@types/node" lib for savings recording.

This 2D role-play game aims to simulate the experiences of an teacher assistant in the CPCT(Computer Programing & Computational Thinking) class of USTC. 
In each level, your tasks are correcting students' codes written in C Language, 
some of which are error-filled or terrible-"handwriting", while some are delicate but have subtle-but-fatal bugs.  
Besides, some students would like to consult or interreput you with 
their confusion when you are busy revising their lab assignments. From basic grammar to chanllenging questions, you will lead them to roam the exquisite realm of C Language.  
But no matter what you may meet, the pleasure to see your students growing into competent programmer is incomparable, right?

This project is a part of the C assignment for the CPCT class of USTC, pull requests are welcome after it is submitted and rated.
